## 🚀 What is this?

Tired of the endless algorithmic rabbit hole? **YouTube Watch Later Focus** is a Chrome extension that transforms your YouTube homepage from a distraction machine into a productivity tool.

**No redirects. No distractions. Just your curated list.**

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Zero Distractions**: Replaces the default "Recommended" feed instantly.
- **⚡ Seamless Integration**: Works in-place without redirecting you to a playlist page.
